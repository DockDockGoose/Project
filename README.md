# "DayTrading Distributed System Project" 
<em>University Of Victoria  
SENG 468 - Software Scalability</em> 

## [Project Documentation](https://github.com/DockDockGoose/Project/blob/main/documentation/ProjectDocumentation.md)

## Setup Information
 [Follow these instructions to set up Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/install/#installing-official-release)
 
Make sure you have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed.

Project is in the stocksite folder. 

Before running a local instance, you have to run 

```
django-project\Scripts\activate
```

then you can go into 
```
stocksite/
```
and run 
```
python manage.py runserver
```
##  Setup Stock Site on Docker

If you would like to run the application on Docker follow these steps. Please note, before starting make sure you have [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed. 

Go into stocksite directory and run the application:
```
cd stocksite
docker-compose up
```

Head to http://localhost:8000/ to see application running ðŸŽ‰

To view web and db containers:
```
docker ps
```

To get into database container:
```
docker-compose run db bash
```

Shutdown containers using `Ctrl-c` or `docker-compose down`.

## Workload Generator
Takes workload input file and partitions commands per user, retaining transaction number, 
command, stock symbol and other related information.
Writes each partition to a file in the format of ```[user].txt```. Each partition file is read and a thread is spawned per user (the WG dynamically adjusts the port number). 
The files are parsed and the requested commands are sent in JSON format to the specified server.

<em>The default server and port is ```localhost:65432```</em>

To run using the default 1 user workload file:
```
python3 workload_gen.py
```
To run using a specific workload file (eg. WL_2_USER.txt):
```
python3 workload_gen.py ../workloads/WL_2_USER.txt
```


## Running the Python WebServer
This python webserver will immediately spin up and start accepting client requests. 

<em>The default server and port is ```localhost:65432```</em>

To run the server:
```
python web_server.py
```
 * to send simulated requests to the webserver see workload generator section above. 
 * To end the server I use (ctrl+ALT+(BREAK/PAUSE)), maybe CRTL+Z, CRTL+C would work for different users
